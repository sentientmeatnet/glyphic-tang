LibreOffice colors inspired by the choices in Gliffy and Linux's Tango color
set. To install the color palette, find where LibreOffice stores the
color configuration file, standard.soc

Rename the existing standard.soc to something else, like standard-bak.soc.
Then move the provided standard.soc into the same directory. Restart
LibreOffice.
